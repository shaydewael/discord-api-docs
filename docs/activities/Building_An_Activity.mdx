# Building Your First Activity in Discord

> preview
> Creating Activities is currently available as a [Public Developer Preview](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/public-developer-preview).

[Activities](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW) are web-based games and apps that can be run within Discord. They can be opened [TODO: channel, in response to interaction, etc.] If this is your first time learning about Activities, check out the [Activities Overview](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW) for more information and a collection of more advanced [sample projects](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/sample-projects).


## Introduction

This guide assumes an understanding of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) and [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), and a basic understanding of frontend frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). If you are still learning to program, there are many free education resources to explore like [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development), and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).

<Collapsible title="What we'll be building" icon="view">

In this guide, we'll be building a Discord app with a basic Activity that handles user authentication and fetches data using the API:

## Step 1: Setting up the project

Before creating an app, let's set up our project code from the [discord/getting-started-activity](https://github.com/discord/getting-started-activity) repository.

The sample project's code uses includes a minimal frontend for our Activity and backend with vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). As you're building your own Activity, you can use whichever backend you prefer. TODO: revise

Open your command line and clone the project code:

```
git clone git@github.com:discord/getting-started-activity.git
```

Then navigate to the directory:
```
cd getting-started-activity
```

<Collapsible title="Project structure" description="Overview of the project structure for the sample app used in this guide" icon="code">

```
├── client
│   ├── main.js       -> your Activity frontend
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── package.json
|   |── rocket.png
│   ├── vite.config.js
├── server
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── server.js     -> your Activity backend
└── .env              -> your credentials, ids and secrets
```

</Collapsible>

### Set Up Your Frontend

Now that our environment variables are set up, let's spin up our frontend.


```
# from inside the getting-started-activity/ directory:

cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you visit http://localhost:5173/ you will see a vanilla JS frontend template running with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). If you look at the code from the template, you can see that it renders an image but is not calling any Discord APIs or backend services. We will come back to this later in the guide.

---

## Step 2: Creating an app

> preview
> During the Developer Preview, it is recommended you create a new app for testing purposes. There are [limitations for Activities](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/public-developer-preview) during this preview period.

First, create a new app in the developer portal if you don't have one already:

<Button href="https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true" color="brand">Create App</Button>

Enter a name for your app, select a development team, then press **Create**.

> info
> **Development Team Access** <br />While developing your application, it will only be launchable or joinable by your user or any member of your developer team. It often makes sense to make a [developer team](https://discord.com/developers/teams) and set the team as the application's owner, especially if you know you will collaborate with others during the development phase. TODO: remove second sent?

After you create your app, you'll land on the **General Overview** page of the app's settings, where you can update basic information about your app like its description and icon.

### Choose installation contexts

Next, we'll configure our app's supported [installation contexts](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/installation-context). This determines where it can be installed: to servers, to users' accounts, or to both.

TODO: creating commands (/docs/interactions/application-commands#installation-context) + handling interactions.


<Collapsible title="What are installation contexts?" description="Overview of where apps can be installed" icon="question">

> info
> Some apps may only want to support one installation context—for example, a moderation app may only support a server context. However, by default, we recommend supporting both installation contexts. For detailed information about supporting user-installed apps, you can read the [user-installable app tutorial](#DOCS_TUTORIALS_DEVELOPING_A_USER_INSTALLABLE_APP).

**Installation contexts** determine where your app can be installed: to servers, to users, or both. Apps can choose which installation contexts they support within the app's settings. 

- Apps installed in a **[server context](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/server-context)** (server-installed apps) must be authorized by a server member with the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission, and are visible to all members of the server.
- Apps installed in a **[user context](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/user-context)** (user-installed apps) are visible only to the authorizing user, and therefore don't require any server-specific permissions. Apps installed to a user context are visible across all of the user's servers, DMs, and GDMs—however, they're limited to using commands.
</Collapsible>

Click on **Installation** in the left sidebar, then under **Installation Contexts** make sure both "User Install" and "Guild Install" are selected. This will make sure users can launch our app's Activity across Discord—in servers, DMs, and in Group DMs. TOOD: wording


### Enable Activities

Next, we'll need to enable Activities for your app. On the left hand sidebar under **Activities**, click **Getting Started**.

Review this page and press **Enable**.

After enabling Activities, you'll see the different Activity-related pages in your app's settings. Across these pages, you'll be able to update information like supported platforms, upload assets, and configure Activity-specific settings. We'll come back to this page later in this guide to set up URL mappings.

TODO: screenshot

#### Default Entry Point Command

When you enable Activities for your app, a [default Entry Point command](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/default-entry-point-command) called "Launch" is automatically created. This [Entry Point command](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/entry-point-commands) is the primary way for users to launch your Activity in Discord.

By default, interactions with this command will result in Discord opening your Activity for the user and posting a message in the channel where it was launched from. However, if you prefer to handle the interactions in your app, you can update the [`handler` field](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/entry-point-handlers) or create your own. Additional details are in the Entry Point command [documentation](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/entry-point-commands) and [development guide](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/setting-up-an-entry-point-command).

### Set your Redirect URI

Next, we'll set up a redirect URI, which is where a user is redirected to after authorization with your app. The Embedded App SDK handles redirecting a user back to your Activity when [authorizing](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/authorize), so the value for the redirect URI isn't important unless you want to offer authorization outside of your Activity. TODO: can tie more to oauth

You can learn more about the OAuth flow and redirect URIs in the [OAuth2 documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2), but for now we'll just use a placeholder value (like `https://127.0.0.1`).

Click on **OAuth2** on the sidebar in your app's settings. Under **Redirects**, enter `https://127.0.0.1` as a placeholder value then click **Save Changes**.

![Configure your Activity](activities/oauth2-redirect.png)

### Fetch Your OAuth2 Credentials

To use information related to a user (like their username) or a server (like its avatar), your app must be granted specific OAuth **scopes**.

For our sample app, we'll be requesting three scopes: `identify` to access basic information about a user, `guilds` to access information about the guilds a user is in, and `applications.commands` to install [commands](#TODO). We'll request these later on in the guide, but a full list of scopes you can request is in the [OAuth2 documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes). TODO: put in collapse?

When requesting scopes, you'll need your app's OAuth2 identifiers which we'll copy into your project's environment file. In the root of your project folder, there is an `example.env` file. Copy that into a new `.env` file:

```
cp example.env .env
```

We'll need to add two values to this file. Back in your app's settings, click on **OAuth2** on the sidebar:
1. **Client ID**: Copy the value for Client ID and add it to your `.env` file as **`VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`**. This is the public ID that Discord associates with your app, and is almost always the same as your App ID.
2. **Client Secret**: Copy the value for Client Secret and add it to your `.env` as **`DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`**. This is a private, sensitive identifier that your app will use to grant an OAuth2 `access_token`, and should never be stored in the client-side code.

TODO: clean up Vite explanation



> info
> **Why is there a VITE_ prefix before our Client ID?**<br />Prefixing the `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` environment variable with `VITE_` makes it accessible to our client-side code. This security measure ensures that only the variables you intend to be accessible in the browser are available, and all other environment variables remain private. [Read more in the Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode)

Any `VITE_` prefixed variables are then made available to us in our code via `import.meta.env` such as `import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`.

> warn
> **Secure Your Secrets**<br /> Your `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` should always be considered sensitive secrets.

## Step 3: Installing the Embedded App SDK

TODO: check in—"by now you should have x, y, z"

TODO: explain Embedded App SDK

<Collapsible title="Install the SDK to your package.json" open>

From inside our `getting-started-activity/client` folder, we will install the Embedded App SDK.

```
npm install @discord/embedded-app-sdk
```
</Collapsible>

This will add `@discord/embedded-app-sdk` to `getting-started-activity/client/package.json` and install the SDK in your `node_modules` folder.

Once installed, we need to import it into our client code and instantiate it to start the handshake between our app and the Discord client.

<Collapsible title="Add the SDK to your Project" open>

To instantiate the SDK, we will use the environment variables we set up earlier. The `VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` variable is available to us through `import.meta.env`.

We also set up our check for the `ready` event with an async/await function. This allows us to output a log or take action once the initial handshake was successful.

Let's import and instantiate the SDK in `getting-started-activity/client/main.js`:
```js
// Import the SDK
import { DiscordSDK } from "@discord/embedded-app-sdk";

import "./style.css";
import rocketLogo from '/rocket.png';

// Instantiate the SDK
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID);

setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is ready");
});

async function setupDiscordSdk() {
  await discordSdk.ready();
}

document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <img src="${rocketLogo}" class="logo" alt="Discord" />
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </div>
`;
```
</Collapsible>

> warn
> **Time to leave your browser behind**<br />Once you add the SDK to your app, you will **not** be able to view your app inside your web browser. In the next step, we will run your Activity inside of Discord. In the next step, we will go over how to view you app in Discord.

---

## Step 4: Running your app in Discord

Let's ensure everything is wired up correctly before we move on to authenticating with Discord.

To run your application locally, we recommend a network tunnel, such as `cloudflared` or `ngrok.`

In one terminal, let's start our client-side app:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

`client terminal output`
```
VITE v5.0.12  ready in 100 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Let's start our network tunnel for port 5173 in another terminal window.

```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
```

When you run `cloudflared`, the tunnel will generate a public URL for you that we will use in the next step.

```
Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):
https://funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com
```

Let's copy that URL and take it into our next step.

### Set up your Activity URL Mapping

To serve your application, you must set up a URL mapping to where your app is hosted. For this tutorial, your app is hosted locally and being served via your network tunnel.

Click on `Activities` -> `URL Mappings` in your application settings. Enter the URL you generated from `cloudflared` in the previous step.

![Configuring your URL Mapping](activities/url-mapping-tutorial.png)

| PREFIX | TARGET                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/`    | `funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com` |

Read more about the specific rules and details for URL mapping [here](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/url-mapping).

### Enable Developer Mode in your Client

One more step before we can see our work inside of Discord!

If you haven't already, go to your `User Settings` -> `Advanced` and toggle on the `Developer Mode` setting. Developer Mode exposes context menu items for building apps, including giving you access to Activities that you are working on.

![Enabling Developer Mode in Settings](activities/developer-mode.gif)

### Running your Activity in Discord

Now that we are pointing Discord to our locally running app, we can launch it in Discord!

In a voice channel in your Discord server, click on the Activities icon (🚀) to see your Activity at the top of the Activity Shelf.

Clicking on your app will launch your locally running app from inside Discord!

![Running your activity](activities/start-activity.png)

> info
> **Customizing your Activity** <br/> If you'd like to set images for your Activity, you can learn how to do that [here](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/setting-up-activity-metadata).

We're looking pretty good so far, but we haven't wired up any Discord functionality yet. Let's do that next.

---

## Step 5: Authorizing & authenticating users

To fully authenticate your activity with the users playing it, we must finish implementing our server-side app and get it talking to the client-side app.

We will use `express` for this example, but any backend language or framework will work here.

<Collapsible title="OAuth2 Flow Diagram" icon="view">

This diagram illustrates the common pattern for granting a user an OAuth2 access_token:

![Flow diagram for Oauth2](activities/oauth-flow-diagram.svg)

We will be implementing this pattern in this tutorial, but more example implementations can also be found in this sample project:

- [Back-end code](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk-examples/blob/main/discord-embedded-app-starter/packages/server/src/app.ts)
- [Front-end code](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk-examples/blob/main/discord-embedded-app-starter/packages/client/src/main.ts)

</Collapsible>

```
# move into our server directory
cd server

# install dependencies
npm install
```

We aren't going to edit the server code here, but it consists of a single POST route for `/api/token` that allows us to perform the Oauth2 flow from the server securely.

<Collapsible title="getting-started-activity/server/server.js" icon="view">
```javascript
import express from "express";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import fetch from "node-fetch";
dotenv.config({ path: "../.env" });

const app = express();
const port = 3001;

// Allow express to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/api/token", async (req, res) => {

  // Exchange the code for an access_token
  const response = await fetch(`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      client_id: process.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET,
      grant_type: "authorization_code",
      code: req.body.code,
    }),
  });

  // Retrieve the access_token from the response
  const { access_token } = await response.json();

  // Return the access_token to our client as { access_token: "..."}
  res.send({access_token});
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
</Collapsible>

```
npm run dev
```

`server terminal output`
```
> server@1.0.0 dev
> node server.js

Server listening at http://localhost:3001
```

We can now run our server and client-side apps in separate terminal windows. You can see other ways to set this up in our [Sample Projects](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/sample-projects).

### Calling external resources from your activity

Before we call your backend activity server, we need to be aware of the Discord proxy and understand how to avoid Content Security Policy (CSP) issues.

> info
> For this tutorial, we are going to simply prefix the API call to `/api/token/` with `/.proxy`, but you can also use the SDK's `patchUrlMappings()` method to automatically prefix calls to your external resources for the proxy.

Learn more about this topic in the guides for [Constructing a Full URL](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/construct-a-full-url) and [Using External Resources](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/using-external-resources).

### Calling your backend server from your client

We're almost there! Now, we need our client application to communicate with our server so we can start the OAuth process and get an access token.

> info
> **What is vite.config.js?**<br />
> To allow our frontend app to call our Express server, Vite requires us to set up a proxy for `/api/*` to our backend server, which is running on port 3001. In their docs, you can learn more about [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

`getting-started-activity/client/main.js`

```javascript
import { DiscordSDK } from "@discord/embedded-app-sdk";

import rocketLogo from '/rocket.png';
import "./style.css";

// Will eventually store the authenticated user's access_token
let auth;

const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID);

setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  // We can now make API calls within the scopes we requested in setupDiscordSDK()
  // Note: the access_token returned is a sensitive secret and should be treated as such
});

async function setupDiscordSdk() {
  await discordSdk.ready();
  console.log("Discord SDK is ready");

  // Authorize with Discord Client
  const { code } = await discordSdk.commands.authorize({
    client_id: import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
    response_type: "code",
    state: "",
    prompt: "none",
    scope: [
      "identify",
      "guilds",
      "applications.commands"
    ],
  });

  // Retrieve an access_token from your activity's server
  // Note: We need to prefix our backend `/api/token` route with `/.proxy` to stay compliant with the CSP.
  // Read more about constructing a full URL and using external resources at
  // https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/development-guides#construct-a-full-url
  const response = await fetch("/.proxy/api/token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      code,
    }),
  });
  const { access_token } = await response.json();

  // Authenticate with Discord client (using the access_token)
  auth = await discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
    access_token,
  });

  if (auth == null) {
    throw new Error("Authenticate command failed");
  }
}

document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <img src="${rocketLogo}" class="logo" alt="Discord" />
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </div>
`;
```

Now if we relaunch our app, we'll be prompted to authorize with Discord using the `identify`, `guilds`, and `applications.commands` scopes.

![Prompt to authorize Activity](activities/tutorial-auth.png)

> warn
> **Safe storage of tokens**<br />
> Access tokens and refresh tokens are powerful, and should be treated similarly to passwords or other highly-sensitive data. Store both types of tokens securely and in an encrypted manner.

> info
> If you want to remove the authorization, you can view your application under `Authorized Apps` under your user profile. If you click the `Deauthorize` button next to your app, you can go through the OAuth2 flow when you relaunch your activity.

---

## Step 6: Use the SDK to fetch the channel

Now that we have authenticated our users, we can start interacting with contextual Discord information that we can use in our application.

Let's use the SDK to get details about the voice channel that our activity is running in. We can do this by writing a new async function that uses the `commands.getChannel` SDK method.

`getting-started-activity/client/main.js`

```javascript
async function appendVoiceChannelName() {
  const app = document.querySelector('#app');

  let activityChannelName = 'Unknown';

  // Requesting the channel in GDMs (when the guild ID is null) requires
  // the dm_channels.read scope which requires Discord approval.
  if (discordSdk.channelId != null && discordSdk.guildId != null) {
    // Over RPC collect info about the channel
    const channel = await discordSdk.commands.getChannel({channel_id: discordSdk.channelId});
    if (channel.name != null) {
      activityChannelName = channel.name;
    }
  }

  // Update the UI with the name of the current voice channel
  const textTagString = `Activity Channel: "${activityChannelName}"`;
  const textTag = document.createElement('p');
  textTag.textContent = textTagString;
  app.appendChild(textTag);
}
```

Now, let's update the callback after `setupDiscordSdk()` to call our new function. If we close and rejoin our activity in Discord, we should now see the name of the current channel in our app!

```javascript
setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  appendVoiceChannelName();
});
```

Now when we launch our Activity, we will dynamically see the name of our voice channel populate in our app.

![Discord Activities](activities/tutorial-channel-name.png)

---

## Step 7: Use the API to fetch the guild

Since we requested the `identify` and `guilds` scopes, you can also use the authorized `access_token` we received earlier to fetch those resources via the API.

- In the following code block, we will use the `/users/@me/guilds` endpoint in combination with `auth.access_token` to get a list of the guilds we are in.
- We will then iterate over each guild to find the guild we are in based on the `guildId` defined in discordSdk.
- Finally, we can create a new HTML image element with the guild avatar and append it to our application.

> info
> In this example, we use a pure `fetch` request to call the REST API. However, this is a great place to use your favorite Discord JavaScript library alongside the Embedded App SDK.

`getting-started-activity/client/main.js`

```javascript
async function appendGuildAvatar() {
  const app = document.querySelector('#app');

  // 1. From the HTTP API fetch a list of all of the user's guilds
  const guilds = await fetch(`https://discord.com/api/v10/users/@me/guilds`, {
    headers: {
      // NOTE: we're using the access_token provided by the "authenticate" command
      Authorization: `Bearer ${auth.access_token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  }).then((response) => response.json());

  // 2. Find the current guild's info, including it's "icon"
  const currentGuild = guilds.find((g) => g.id === discordSdk.guildId);

  // 3. Append to the UI an img tag with the related information
  if (currentGuild != null) {
    const guildImg = document.createElement('img');
    guildImg.setAttribute(
      'src',
      // More info on image formatting here: https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#image-formatting
      `https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/${currentGuild.id}/${currentGuild.icon}.webp?size=128`
    );
    guildImg.setAttribute('width', '128px');
    guildImg.setAttribute('height', '128px');
    guildImg.setAttribute('style', 'border-radius: 50%;');
    app.appendChild(guildImg);
  }
}
```

Finally, let's call our new function that uses the Discord API.

```javascript
setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  appendVoiceChannelName();
  appendGuildAvatar();
});
```

If we relaunch our Activity, we will also see our the current server's avatar render in our app.
