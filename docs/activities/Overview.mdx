# Overview of Activities

![Building Discord Activities](activities/activities-hero.png)

Activities are multiplayer games and social experiences that can be launched in Discord. Activities can integrate with Discord features like user identity, voice and chat, profile data, and native monetization.

Under the hood, Activities are single page web apps hosted in an iframe which communicate with Discord clients using the [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK). Read about Activities built by other developers in our [case studies](https://discord.com/build#case-studies).

## Launching Activities in Discord

After you have Activities enabled in your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications), your app can launch Activities in two ways:
1. When a user invokes your app's Entry Point command in the App Launcher
2. By responding to an interaction with the `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` callback type

Each of these are covered in more detail in the below sections.

### Entry Point Command

Activities are primarily opened by users invoking your app's [Entry Point command](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/entry-point-commands) in the [App Launcher](#TODO).

When you enable Activities for your app, a [default Entry Point command](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/default-entry-point-command) called "Launch" is created for your app. Discord automatically handles responding to the default Entry Point command invocation, but you can change this behavior by updating its [handler type](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/application-command-object-entry-point-command-handler-types).

Read more about setting up Entry Point commands in the [development guide](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/setting-up-an-entry-point-command).

### Interaction Response

Activities can be launched in response to most of your app's interactions (like when a command is invoked, or when a user clicks a button from your app). To open an Activity in response to an interaction, you can set use the `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` (type `12`) [interaction callback type](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type).

Launching an Activity in response to an interaction is limited to `APPLICATION_COMMAND` (`2`), `MESSAGE_COMPONENT` (`3`), and `MODAL_SUBMIT` (`5`) [interaction types](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object-interaction-type).

## Developing Activities

Whether you're developing a multiplayer game, a new social experience, or another creative idea, your Activity will be built as a web app that is run in an iframe in Discord on desktop, mobile, and web. You can get started by following the guide on [Building an Activity using the Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY).

The below sections contain some information about communicating with Discord clients and sample projects you can use as a starting point, but more technical details about how Activities are run in Discord is covered on the [How Activities Work](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_HOW_ACTIVITIES_WORK) page.

### Embedded App SDK

The [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK) handles all of the communication between Discord and your app, making it easier to do common tasks like managing connected users, supporting mobile clients, and debugging your Activity. 

The Embedded App SDK offers different events and commands to handle the communication between Discord and your Activity, which are covered more below.

#### Commands

The SDK has a set of commands you can call to interact with a Discord client, given you have the appropriate scopes. This is helpful when you want to do things like:

- **Authorize and authenticate clients**. New clients can be authorized using `authorize`, and existing clients can be authenticated using `authenticate()` TODO: update
- **Fetch information about your Activity**. For example, [`getInstanceConnectedParticipants()`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/getinstanceconnectedparticipants) can be used to retrieve all users connected to your Activity instance. 
- **Update information for your Activity or an authenticated user**. For example, [`openShareMomentDialog()`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/opensharemomentdialog) can be used to let an authenticated user share media related to your Activity.

Read the [Embedded App SDK documentation](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/sdk-commands) for a full list of commands, and details about each command.

#### Events

The SDK also has events you can subscribe (or unsubscribe) to for things happening in a connected client that are relevant to your Activity, given you have the appropriate scopes. This is helpful when you want to do things like:

- **Handle connection and errors**
- **Listen to updates about a connected user**. For example, [`ORIENTATION_UPDATE`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/orientationupdate) is sent when the screen orientation changes for a user, and voice-related changes like [`SPEAKING_START`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/speakingstart) and [`SPEAKING_STOP`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/speakingstop) like there's a change in their voice state.
- **Listen to events related to your Activity instance**. For example, [`ACTIVITY_INSTANCE_PARTICIPANTS_UPDATE`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/activityinstanceparticipantsupdate) is sent when the number of instance participants changes.

Read the [Embedded App SDK documentation](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/sdk-events) for a full list of events, and details for each event.
